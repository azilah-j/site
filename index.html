<!-- All the statements presented are factually correct. They accurately describe the Melanau word for "house" and the linguistic diversity within the Melanau language. Statement-by-statement analysis
lebok /ləˈbɒk/ — pronounced luh-BOCK: A Melanau dictionary confirms that "lebok" is a word in the language, often for "home". The phonetic pronunciation /ləˈbɒk/ and its anglicized form "luh-BOCK" are a standard way to represent the sound, which aligns with how the "o" vowel is pronounced in many Bornean languages.
Lebok is a word from the Melanau language. It means "house" or "home".: This is correct. Online Melanau glossaries and dictionaries, such as on nativeglot.com, define "lebok" as meaning "home".
The Melanau language is rich with a variation of dialects. It is primarily due to the geography of Melanau communities living along Sarawak's vast coastline and river systems. The dialects are often so different that they are not mutually intelligible.: This is a core feature of the Melanau language, supported by linguistic research. The geographical isolation of Melanau communities along coastal and river systems is the main cause of the dialect chain, where neighboring dialects can understand each other, but those further apart cannot.
This variation — lebok /ləˈbɒk/ — reflects the Mukah dialect.: This is correct. Mukah is a major Melanau dialect spoken in a central coastal region, and it is a common reference point for the language.
In other variations, it can appear as lebuk, pronounced luh-BUUK.: This is a known dialectal variation, where vowels change between different Melanau communities. This illustrates the phonological differences that create distinct dialects.
More variations are kubou, and lamin, with lamin sometimes referring to a longhouse.: This is correct, but with a nuance regarding lamin.
Kubou: Facebook pages for learning the Melanau dialect of Dalat list "kubou" as a word for "house". This demonstrates yet another lexical variation across dialects.
Lamin: While lamin is often associated with longhouses, particularly in Indonesian Borneo, the word itself is derived from Proto-Austronesian and is present in various forms in Borneo. In Melanau, it can refer to a specific type of traditional house, like the Lamin Dana cultural center in Mukah, which is a reconstructed Melanau longhouse. This shows a specialized or dialectal use of the word. -->
